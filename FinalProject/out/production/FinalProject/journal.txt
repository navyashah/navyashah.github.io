JOURNAL ENTRY #1
Thursday 04/27:

Overview: Reworked rough UML diagram with peer feedback.
          Started set-up for all the packages and classes, making constructors and IVs.

        (3HRS Coding SESSION)
            added in BFF
            set up basics of User and Party hierarchies
                MVC packages organized
            set up the Premium interface
            set up enum for party types

        To do next time:
                1. Improve the functionality of interface and its implementation
                2. Fix the plan method from abstract Party class
                3. Begin the inviting method implementation
                4. Design the different User subclass functionality (what does host do, what does guest do)

        OH Questions:
                1. Exclusive class' implementation of premium interface
                2. How to differentiate the party subclasses better
                    By different plan methods?? Using setName...etc in plan method

JOURNAL ENTRY #2
Sunday 04/30:

Overview: Designed the User subclass functionality
          Worked on making fake data

          (2HR Coding SESSION)
              create user subclasses
              added the methods to each specific subclass
              created user fake data

          To do next time:
                1. Work on evite system
                2. Party fake data
                3. Exclusive interface reworking

          OH Questions:
                1. How to create subclass specific fake data for parties
                    I want the questions to be on the invite receiver's end rather than party creator
                2. What should be in EviteSystem vs the subclasses (how elaborate the methods need to be)

JOURNAL ENTRY #3
Monday 05/01:

Overview: Fixed problems with Party and User subclasses
          Worked on Evite System menu and account creating, login, logout, verifying

          (2+2HR Coding SESSIONS)
                understood with help in OH that how I can make some features from the User side for parties
                created EviteMenu enum and made the case switch with it similar to A07
                reworked the fake data part for quite sometime, confused between file reading and making fake data method

          To do next time:
                1. Work on RSVP, sendinvite, and view invite methods
                2. Fix the fake data problem

          OH Questions:
                1. How to parse localdate? Do it as string?
                2. If making fake data, how to put it in Map as value

JOURNAL ENTRY #4
Tuesday 05/02:

Overview: Setup reading from files to better create the objects and then put them in their respective maps
          Created the create party method

          (2HR + 3HR Coding SESSIONS)
                successfully read and parsed data from users and parties files
                create party method is specific for each type of party
                created methods to upgrade current user to premium or a guest to host
                worked on building the map of the two databases

          To do next time:
                1. View all parties invited to
                2. Send invite, when creating party?
                3. RSVP method

          OH Questions:
                1. How to store parties in a list

JOURNAL ENTRY #5
Wednesday 05/03:

Overview: Created view parties methods based on category
          Created two lists: parties invited to and parties hosting

          (3HR Coding SESSIONS)
                built maps of the two databases
                worked on putting the read data into those maps
                worked on creating the lists for parties to build rsvp and send invite methods
                built basic design of rsvp and invite

          To do next time:
                1. Save data to files
                2. Issue with menu?
                3. Improve RSVP

          OH Questions:
                1. Cannot understand RSVP and invite

JOURNAL ENTRY #6
Thursday 05/04:

Overview: Created the RSVP and invite method
          Tried to build functionality such that a guest can accept or decline the RSVP

          (2+2HR Coding SESSIONS)
                built accessors for the two lists: parties invited and parties hosting
                tried to link the data from the csv file to parties hosting
                made another method to find the host name if it was there in the list of parties
                not sucessful as the partydatabase map returned a collection of lists, couldnt find hostname from that


          To do next time:
                1. Save data to files
                2. RSVP with options?

          OH Questions:
                1. Still struggling with RSVP and invite

JOURNAL ENTRY #7
Friday 05/05:

Overview: Worked more on the guestlist and adding guests to the list if they rsvp or are invited
          Guestlist was either not linking with the csv data or not updating with user input
          Created updateParty() with menu options for each variable in the party to update

          (4HR Coding SESSIONS)
                built guestlist and incorporated it in the party objects
                created fake guestlists in the csv file that then would be read in as an array
                updateParty asks user for input to change it, it successfully updates
                does not carry forward in sessions
                does not read csv data for parties hosting to update them
                (problem carried forward from last time where parties hosting is not reading in from csv data
                due to partydatabase having collection of lists, no idea how to find hostname in a collection)

          To do next time:
                1. Fix guestlist
                2. Comment code
                3. updateParty fixes

          OH Questions:
                1. Guestlist doesn't update
                2. Remove guests from list in updateParty()
                3. More interface functionality?

JOURNAL ENTRY #8
Saturday 05/06:

Overview: Fixed the guestlist issue after long discussion in OH!
          Last minute fixes

          (4HR Coding SESSIONS)
                tried again to make parties hosting work in other ways but failed
                guestlist issue fixed but needed to make new one for new parties
                (because without the newGL, the guestlist only reads from files and RSVP/invite methods)
                tried to add more functionality to RSVP
                    like adding what costume you will wear but realised that needed an arraylist or hashmap
                    (too complicated, not enough time)
                worked on final report and commenting the code
